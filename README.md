 ## Dark Signal: The Batman Blinky Board
Building this project was a huge milestone for me. I wanted to move beyond a basic "LED on a breadboard" and create something that actually looked like it belonged in Gotham. Using the Hack Club guide was a game-changer; it turned the intimidating world of PCB design into a fun, step-by-step puzzle that I actually enjoyed solving.
