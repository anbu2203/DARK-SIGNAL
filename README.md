# DARK-SIGNAL
Following the Hack Club guide made the whole process way less intimidating, especially when it came to understanding how chips like the 555 timer and 4017 counter actually talk to each other to create that cool chasing light effect. It was awesome to see a bunch of random components turn into a sleek, pulsing Bat-signal right on my desk.
