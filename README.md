 ## Dark Signal: The Batman Blinky Board
Building this project was a huge milestone for me. I wanted to move beyond a basic "LED on a breadboard" and create something that actually looked like it belonged in Gotham. Using the Hack Club guide was a game-changer; it turned the intimidating world of PCB design into a fun, step-by-step puzzle that I actually enjoyed solving.

It showcases the 3mm Red LEDs following the curves of the wings and the NE555P/4017 chips acting as the central "engine."
The Potentiometer (RV1) is prominently placed, allowing the user to manually dial in the speed of the chasing lights.
